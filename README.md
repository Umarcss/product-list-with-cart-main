## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add or remove items from the cart.
- Increase or decrease the number of items for a product.
- See an order confirmation modal after placing an order.
- Start a new order, which clears the cart.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup**: For clear, accessible, and well-structured content.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: To maintain a consistent and easily manageable design system.
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**: For creating a robust, responsive layout that works on all screen sizes.
- **Mobile-First Workflow**: Ensuring a seamless experience on mobile before scaling up to desktop.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For dynamic content rendering, state management, and all user interactions.

### What I Learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to build a complete, interactive component from the ground up. Here are some of the key things I learned:

- **Dynamic UI Rendering**: I practiced fetching data from a JSON file and using it to dynamically generate the product list and cart items. This makes the application more scalable and maintainable.
- **Complex State Management**: Managing the state of the shopping cart (adding, removing, and updating item quantities) was a great challenge. I learned how to keep the UI perfectly in sync with the underlying data.
- **Responsive Design for Interactive Components**: Making the layout fully responsive was key. I particularly enjoyed creating the different experiences for the order confirmation modal on mobile (as a bottom sheet) versus desktop (as a centered pop-up).
- **Attention to Detail**: This project required a sharp eye for detail to match the design files, from the subtle hover and focus states to the pixel-perfect alignment of elements.
